<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](assets/Screenshot_1.png)

This is the first project I've ever made with React. It was interesting learning how components work and also coding in TSX. It was for sure a better first contact with the framework than with Angular.

The project itself is nothing impressive; it's just a major practice for getting used to working with components. When I started this project, I decided that my path through React was going to be steep in matters of difficulty. First I was going to start with a project only focused on components like this one, then a more complicated project using React Hooks, then start using other libraries, etc. Yet after all this work, I realized that I spent plenty more time working with the CSS code of this project than with React, which is supposed to be the main focus of these front-end challenges.

That is why, after that sort of revelation, I decided not to struggle with the CSS code (that is why it's a bit clumsy), finish the project as soon as possible, and then start learning about what this framework really has to offer.

Overall, it was a great experience and a nice first glance at React. For the next project, I will try to use different libraries to help me with the front-end process to be able to stop using a lot of pure CSS code.
